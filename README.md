A package providing an interface between R and the Artificial Life Framework (ALF: http://alfsim.org), a software program for simulating complex genome evolution across phylogenies. At the moment this just does a few basic things with ALF that I need for my current projects. With time, I hope to expand it to utilize the full range of options in ALF, especially if it begins to be adopted by the bioinformatics community for running simulations. It is quite a good program. If you would like to use ALF with R, then it should be possible to modify the code here for your own purposes. Also feel free to ask me to include a particular feature that you want to use.
